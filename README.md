Time spent: ~30 minutes (picking the motors up from some place like 4 kilometers away because Amazon messed up my delivery adress) \
The stepper motors and their controllers arrived today. ![Image of stepper motors and their drivers.](https://github.com/WinterWolfSV/Gyarb_Rubiks_Cube_Robot/assets/61477891/0e0ddaeb-55d4-411d-ad93-947bec653ecc)

I designed the first prototype for the "hand" rotating the cube today, it worked but as I applied the slightest bit of pressure the, lets call them fingers broke off. I belive this can be circumvented in a future version by printing the hand sideways instead of the right way around. The strength should increase, but because of how additive manufacturing works I will need to add support material when printing the fingers sideways. (See picture if the hand and finger talk is confusing). Aside from the issues with the structual integrity, the hand did a good job at rotating the cube. I will have to increase the size of the hole between the fingers because I forgot to add sufficient tolerances to the part resulting in fingers breaking off. The reason I only printed v1 today was because halfway through the print I decided it was time to upgrade my printer to direct drive and started a 3 hour print. Smart. Essentially that prevents me from using the printer until about 10 tonight, and therefore I will continue tomorrow. The design changes I will make tomorrow include, adding tolerances, changing the way of connecting the hand to the arm (the arm will be explained another day), attempting a sideways print and experementing with different rotations of the print for optimal strength. \
